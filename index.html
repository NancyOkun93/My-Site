        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          My name is <strong>Nancy!</strong> Over the last 2 years I have been
          involved in learning about technology such as programming, IT support
          and web design that lead me to pursue a career in the tech industry.
          While assisting to Year Up I was able to visit many of the big players
          in technology. I toured places such as, Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce,
          etc., where I became fascinated with the work environment of these
          companies. From here on, my fascination has increased to the point
          where I want to be part of this and pursue a career in technology in
          the software quality assurance field as a software automation
          engineer.
